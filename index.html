      Bocchi is literally me. No other character can come close to relating 
      to me like her. There is no way you can convince me that I’m not Bocchi. 
      Bocchi could not possibly be any more me. It’s me, and nobody can convince 
      me otherwise. If anyone approached me about this not possibly being me, 
      I immediately shut them down with overwhelming evidence that Bocchi was me. 
      Bocchi is absolutely me; it is indisputable. Why anyone would try to argue 
      that Bocchi is not me is beyond me. If you held two pictures of me and 
      Bocchi side by side, you’d see no difference. I can safely look at Bocchi 
      every day and say, “Yup, she’s me.” I can practically see Bocchi whenever 
      I look at myself in the mirror. I go outside, and people stop me from 
      commenting on how similar I look and act as Bocchi is. I chuckle softly as 
      I’m assured every day Bocchi is me in every way. I can smile each time I 
      get out of bed each morning, knowing that I’ve found my identity with 
      Bocchi and I know my place in this world. It’s amusing how similar she is 
      to me; it’s almost like identical twins. When I first saw Bocchi, I had an 
      existential crisis. What it Bocchi was the real me and I was the fictional 
      being? What if she actually became aware of my existence? Did she have the 
      ability to become self-aware?
